# Changelog

## 1.0.0

The first release. From here on, a program that compiles with one 1.x release compiles with every later 1.x release
and means the same thing (see [Compatibility](README.md#compatibility)).

### The language

- **Records and enums:** immutable records with value equality and `{ ...p, y: 5 }` copies; enums as sum types whose
  variants carry fields.
- **Pattern matching:** exhaustive `match` with guards, nested patterns, literals, ranges (`1..9`, `0..<n`),
  comparisons (`< 0`), list patterns (`[first, ...rest]`), property patterns (`Point { x: 0 }`, `{ Length: > 5 }`),
  `|` alternatives that bind, and `is` tests. Missing cases are errors that name one; unreachable arms are warnings.
- **No null references:** `T?` is `Option<T>`, with `?.`, `??`, `?` and `null` as its None. .NET's nullable APIs are
  read as optionals.
- **Errors as values:** `Result<T, E>`, with `?` to propagate errors.
- **Everything is an expression:** blocks, `if` and `match` have values.
- **Traits, generics and extensions:** traits with default, static and generic methods and inheritance; generic records,
  enums, functions and methods with trait bounds; `extend` to add methods and traits to any type, including `int`,
  `string` and .NET types. Records and enums can declare arithmetic operators.
- **C#'s types and rules:** C#'s numeric types, conversions, overflow, casts, printing and equality.
- **.NET interop:** call any .NET API, implement .NET interfaces, use `out` and `ref` parameters, events, properties,
  indexers, operators (`date > other`, `end - start`), LINQ and .NET attributes (`[JsonPropertyName("id")]`, `[Obsolete]`).
- **Collections and lambdas:** collection literals with spreads (`[0, ...xs]`), arrays, tuples and deconstruction, lambdas
  and function types, the pipe operator `|>`.
- **Control flow:** `for x in xs`, `for i in 1..10`, `while`, `try`/`catch`/`finally`, `throw`, `using`, `defer`.
- **Async and iterators:** `async`/`await`, `await for`, `await using`, and `yield` iterators.
- **Programs:** namespaces, `using`, `private`, and programs of many files.
- **Tests:** `test "name" { … }` blocks with `Assert` and `AssertEqual`.
- **Conventions:** functions and methods are PascalCase (`Print`, `Main`), variables and fields camelCase, as in C#.
  `let` binds immutably and `mut` mutably. Some words are reserved for future versions, such as `const`, `type` and
  `class`.

### Tools

- **The `piper` tool** (`dotnet tool install -g Piper`):
  - `piper run` transpiles, compiles and runs a program;
  - `piper build` writes the C#, or with `--exe` or `--library` compiles an assembly with a PDB;
  - `piper test` runs a program's tests;
  - `piper emit` prints the C#;
  - `piper lsp` runs the language server.
- **`piper.json`** in a program's folder can set its assembly `name` and `output` (`exe` or `library`).
- **The Piper.Build package** compiles a .NET project's `.piper` files with its C#.
- **Source mapping:** errors, stack traces and the debugger point at `.piper` lines.
- **The language server** gives any LSP editor:
  - diagnostics as you type;
  - hover and go to definition;
  - find references and rename;
  - completion and signature help;
  - inlay hints for inferred types;
  - semantic highlighting;
  - a quick fix that adds a match's missing arms;
  - an outline.
- **The VS Code extension:**
  - syntax highlighting and the language server's features;
  - running a program, and its tests, from the editor;
  - debugging with breakpoints in `.piper` files, through the C# extension's debugger.
